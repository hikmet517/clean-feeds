<div><a name="page-1"></a></div>
<p>As long as there have been vaccines against COVID-19, there have been arguments for why people shouldn't get those vaccines. One of the more persistent—and hairier—arguments is that people who have already been infected with the pandemic coronavirus, SARS-CoV-2, don't need a vaccine. An infection will generate immune responses similar to those generated by vaccines, the thinking goes. So, why waste coveted vaccine doses on people who already have immune responses against the virus—which may also needlessly put those people at risk of vaccine side effects, however rare?</p>
<p>It's a reasonable question, and there is legitimate scientific debate about it. There are also different approaches to the issue in terms of public health policy. In Israel, for example, people who have recovered from COVID-19 after testing positive on a PCR test can get a vaccination "<a href="https://corona.health.gov.il/en/directives/green-pass-info/">Green Pass</a>" that's valid for up to six months. The pass allows them entry into various places just as it does for people who are fully vaccinated. In the European Union, some member states offer a similar "<a href="https://ec.europa.eu/commission/presscorner/detail/en/QANDA_21_2781">Digital COVID Certificate</a>" to people who have recovered from COVID-19 <em>and</em> received just one dose of a two-dose mRNA vaccine regimen.</p>
<p>In the US, however, public health officials are unequivocal in their approach: people are categorized as either vaccinated or unvaccinated, regardless of prior infection. It's an approach with many strengths, including robust scientific data supporting vaccination for people who have recovered. That data—which we'll get into below—has consistently shown that immune responses from natural infections are extremely variable, thus unreliable. Vaccines, on the other hand, have repeatedly proven to generate highly protective immune responses.</p></div><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=1802249#p3">Read 16 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=1802249&comments=1">Comments</a></p>]]></content:encoded>

<p>When the first <em>Resident Evil</em> game debuted in 1998, it was an immediate commercial and critical success, spawning several sequel games, comics, novels, and a very lucrative film franchise directed by Paul W.S. Anderson and starring Milla Jovovich. But those films were only loosely based on the games, keeping a few primary characters and the basic concept, but little else. Sony Pictures just dropped the official trailer for its upcoming reboot, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Resident_Evil:_Welcome_to_Raccoon_City"><em>Resident Evil: Welcome to Raccoon City</em></a>, and it looks like it will hew much more closely to the source material than its big-screen predecessors.</p>
<p><strong>(Some spoilers for the first two games in the franchise below, but no major reveals.)</strong></p>
<p>The sixth and final film in the Anderson series was released fairly recently, in 2016. But the franchise made a ton of money, so naturally a complete reboot was in the works by early 2017, with Johannes Roberts (<em>47 Meters Down</em>) at the helm.</p></div><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=1802183#p3">Read 7 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=1802183&comments=1">Comments</a></p>]]></content:encoded>

<p>Last year, Apple released a meaty iOS update for iPhones, but some of the biggest changes didn't make it over to the iPad. This year, the iPhone update is modest—so does that mean that the iPad update is the big one this time around?</p>
<p>Well, that depends on your point of view. iPadOS 15 brings almost everything iOS 15 brought to iPhones, but it also brings those major iOS 14 omissions from last year to the tablet. As a result, iPadOS 15 feels like a significant update if you haven't been using an iPhone lately, but if you've already used iOS 14's new home screen and app library features, it instead ends up feeling like it's late to the party.</p>
<p>We published a lengthy, <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2021/10/ios-15-review-apple-turns-its-focus-to-the-little-things/4/#h2">iPhone-focused review of iOS 15</a> earlier this week. Consider this a short addendum to that review that puts the spotlight on the iPad. Refer to the earlier review for details on new features like Focus that aren't iPad specific or for a list of iPads that are supported by iPadOS 15.</p></div><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=1802043#p3">Read 37 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=1802043&comments=1">Comments</a></p>]]></content:encoded>

<p>Chang'e-5 represented a major step forward for China's lunar program, as it was the first of the country's missions to return samples to Earth. Now the results of dating the samples are in, and it's clear that while the deposits are old, they're young enough to be a bit of an oddity.</p>
<h2>To the Moon and back</h2>
<p>China has now successfully landed several probes and rovers on the lunar surface as part of a larger exploration program. Chang'e 5 represented the next step, as it had a drill to obtain subsurface samples and a return vehicle that could take them back to Earth. The spacecraft <a href="https://arstechnica.com/science/2020/12/china-likely-to-attempt-its-change-5-moon-landing-on-tuesday/">successfully landed</a> almost two years ago, and a few weeks later, it returned <a href="https://arstechnica.com/science/2020/12/china-completes-lunar-sampling-mission-eyes-next-steps-on-the-moon/">roughly 2 kilograms of rock</a> to Earth from the Moon.</p>
<p>China has the benefit of decades of knowledge gained since the Apollo missions, along with a greater theoretical understanding of the Moon's formation. And it carefully chose Chang'e 5's landing site, a large volcanic deposit called the Oceanus Procellarum, thought to be one of the younger areas of the Moon's surface. But "younger" covers a lot of ground, as estimates based on its crater count ranged from 3.2 billion years old down to just 1.2 billion.</p></div><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=1802125#p3">Read 11 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=1802125&comments=1">Comments</a></p>]]></content:encoded>

<p>Cloudflare is not liable for the copyright infringement of websites that use its content-delivery and security services, a federal judge ruled yesterday.</p>
<p>Cloudflare was <a href="https://storage.courtlistener.com/recap/gov.uscourts.cand.339512/gov.uscourts.cand.339512.1.0.pdf">sued in November 2018</a> by Mon Cheri Bridals and Maggie Sottero Designs, two wedding dress manufacturers and sellers that alleged Cloudflare was guilty of contributory copyright infringement because it didn't terminate services for websites that infringed on the dressmakers' copyrighted designs. The companies sought a jury trial, but Judge Vince Chhabria yesterday granted Cloudflare's motion for summary judgment in a <a href="https://storage.courtlistener.com/recap/gov.uscourts.cand.339512/gov.uscourts.cand.339512.151.0.pdf">ruling</a> in US District Court for the Northern District of California.</p>
<p>Chhabria noted that the dressmakers have been harmed "by the proliferation of counterfeit retailers that sell knock-off dresses using the plaintiffs' copyrighted images" and that they have "gone after the infringers in a range of actions, but to no avail—every time a website is successfully shut down, a new one takes its place."

<div><a name="page-1"></a></div>
<p>Hunting, capturing, and eating wild meat comes with its share of risks, both in terms of environmental and human health. The consumption of bushmeat—a term that can be applied to meat from a long roster of wild animals around the world—for instance, can involve endangered species being killed, either accidentally or on purpose. The practice has untapped potential, but we need to strike a balance between sustainable consumption, ecology, and human traditions and livelihoods to get the most out of it, <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-021-98282-4">new research</a> suggests.</p>
<p>A team led by Martin Nielsen, a professor at the University of Copenhagen’s department of food and resource economics, pored over 49 studies about wild meat for their paper. The source material, published between 1973 and 2019, tried to quantify how much wild meat, including many species of mammals and birds, contributed to the diets of a total of 150,000 people living in the Amazonian and Afro-tropical areas. Mainly, this includes small-scale Indigenous farmers living on the fringes of a forest who consume a substantial amount of bushmeat that they kill in the process of protecting their crops from predation, Nielsen said, though some of the bushmeat does come from hunting expeditions.</p>
<p>In the paper, the team also posed a hypothetical question—what would happen if these regions had their wild meat consumption replaced with cattle or poultry production? The answer: it would produce a larger carbon footprint. This hypothetical substitution would see an additional 71 tonnes of carbon released in the case of cattle, or three tonnes for chickens. The averted emissions largely come from avoiding cutting<span style="font-size: 14px;"> down trees for the sake of livestock production.</span></p></div><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=1801919#p3">Read 16 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=1801919&comments=1">Comments</a></p>]]></content:encoded>

<p>YouTube is the most popular video site on Earth, and if you're a for-profit company obsessed with growth, it's actually a bit of a problem that everyone already uses YouTube. The endless quest for more revenue and more watch minutes has led YouTube to expand into areas other than the typical YouTube video.</p></div><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=1801974#p3">Read 7 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=1801974&comments=1">Comments</a></p>]]></content:encoded>

          Ah, crap, here we go again with co-op zombie action in <em>Back 4 Blood</em>.                      [credit:

<p>2021 is apparently the year of <em>Left 4 Dead</em> spiritual successors, with two co-op shooters catching our attention thanks to their ties to that original Valve series: this week's <em><a href="https://amzn.to/3DhM4Zl" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Back 4 Blood</a> </em>and this fall's <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2021/06/the-anacrusis-left-4-dead-sci-fi-persistent-ai-coming-to-pc-xbox-this-fall/"><em>Anacrusis</em></a>.</p>
<p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2020/12/back-4-blood-alpha-test-turns-out-left-4-dead-mixes-well-with-slay-the-spire/"><em>Back 4 Blood</em></a>, developed by Turtle Rock Studios, is first out of the gate, with its zombie co-op action now officially live for people who shell out a whopping $99.99 for the game's "ultimate" edition on Xbox consoles and PC. The more patient among you can wait until October 12, when the standard game not only goes live but becomes a part of paid <a href="https://amzn.to/3oH5ZNl" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Xbox Game Pass</a> subscriptions.</p>
<p>If you need something to tide you over while waiting to get your band of zombie-slaying friends back together, fear not: we have our early copies of the game, and we're eager to see exactly how it looks as a full retail product. The game can no longer hide behind <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2021/08/back-4-blood-beta-impressions-a-template-for-potential-co-op-greatness/">the safe haze of a "beta test,"</a> and we'll see how game balance, technical performance, an unlockable card system, and any microtransactions play out in the real world.</p></div><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=1802034#p3">Read 4 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=1802034&comments=1">Comments</a></p>]]></content:encoded>

<p>It has been a long, pandemic-induced wait, but the official trailer for the second season of <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2020/02/locke-and-key-series-was-worth-the-wait/"><em>Locke and Key</em></a> is finally here. This is Netflix's adaptation of the award-winning <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Locke_%26_Key">comic book series</a> written by Joe Hill and illustrated by Gabe Rodriguez. In our 2020 <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2020/12/tv-technica-2020-our-favorite-shows-and-binges-in-a-year-of-living-distantly/">year-end TV roundup</a>, I wrote that the series successfully brought "the fabled Key House and the darkly fantastical world of the comics to vivid life." I've been eager for more of the story—and we'll be getting a lot more, since the series has already been renewed for a third season.</p>
<p><strong>(Spoilers for the first season below.)</strong></p>
<p>Following the brutal murder of their father, Rendell (Bill Heck, <em>The Alienist</em>), the surviving members of the Locke family—mom Nina (Darby Stanchfield, <em>Scandal</em>) and three children, Tyler (Connor Jessup, <em>Falling Skies</em>), Kinsey (Emilia Jones, <em>Doctor Who</em>), and Bode (Jackson Robert Scott, <em>IT</em> and <em>IT Chapter Two</em>)—arrive at Keyhouse, Rendell's Massachusetts ancestral home. Shortly after arrival, Bode, the youngest sibling, finds a magical key, and then another, and another, each with its own special power. The keys whisper to those who are sensitive to them—and of course, Bode, Tyler, and Kinsey can hear them. </p></div><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=1801801#p3">Read 9 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=1801801&comments=1">Comments</a></p>]]></content:encoded>

<p>On Wednesday and Thursday, General Motors laid out its plan for the coming years to its investors. The company wants "a world with zero crashes, zero emissions, and zero congestion," said Chair and CEO Mary Barra, explaining that GM's investment in electric vehicles and autonomous driving technology has given it an early start.</p>
<p>GM revealed that a new electric Silverado truck will be formally unveiled at CES in 2022, and a $30,000 Chevrolet electric crossover is also in development. Both of these models, as well as electric Buicks, GMCs, Hummer EVs, and Cadillacs, will use GM's new family of <a href="https://arstechnica.com/cars/2020/03/general-motors-announces-new-battery-platform-claims-100kwh-soon/">Ultium batteries</a> and <a href="https://arstechnica.com/cars/2020/09/this-family-of-electric-motors-will-drive-gms-new-electric-vehicles/">Ultium Drive motors</a>.</p>
<p>Some or all of those vehicles will be equipped with GM's Super Cruise hands-free driver-assistance system, but the company soon plans to deploy an even more capable hands-free driver-assistance system. Called Ultra Cruise, it will eventually allow for "hands-free driving in 95 percent of all driving scenarios," GM says.</p></div><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=1802014#p3">Read 5 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=1802014&comments=1">Comments</a></p>]]></content:encoded>

<p>Gaming peripherals-maker SteelSeries is being purchased by GN, the owner of audio equipment company Jabra. The deal announced Wednesday gives GN access to SteelSeries’ headsets, keyboards, mice, and other peripherals for PC and console gaming, as well as its sub-brands, like Nahimic.</p>
<p>Denmark-based GN is buying SteelSeries from Axcel, a Nordic private equity firm, in a deal that reportedly amounts to 8 billion DKK (about $1.2 billion).</p>
<p>Founded in 2001 in Denmark, SteelSeries has made a name for itself with a large selection of advanced peripherals targeting console and PC gamers. As an audio company, GN is undoubtedly interested in SteelSeries’ Arctis headset lineup, which comprises a wide range of prices and form factors and has become a go-to brand among gamers. SteelSeries also has a reputation with other types of peripherals, including its Apex Pro mechanical keyboard (you’ll regularly see gamers sharing <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/PeelSeries?src=hashtag_click">social media posts</a> of the keyboard as they peel the sticker off its unique OLED screen).</p></div><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=1801977#p3">Read 6 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=1801977&comments=1">Comments</a></p>]]></content:encoded>

<p>Most people shouldn't rush out to install brand-new operating system versions on day one, and <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2021/10/windows-11-the-ars-technica-review/">Windows 11</a> is no exception to that rule. <a href="https://www.amd.com/en/support/kb/faq/pa-400">AMD has published information about a pair of bugs</a> that can reduce performance for Ryzen processors running Windows 11 by as much as 15 percent, though how much slowdown you observe will vary based on what you're doing and the CPU you're using. AMD expects both bugs to be fixed later this month.</p>
<p>The first issue AMD has identified increases L3 cache latency by up to three times, affecting apps that rely on fast memory performance. AMD says that most affected apps will slow down by between 3 and 5 percent but that some "games commonly used for eSports" could see dips of between 10 and 15 percent. AMD says that a Windows update will fix this issue later this month, so as long as you're checking for and installing Windows updates regularly, you won't need to do anything special to resolve the problem.</p>

<p>The second bug is related to an AMD processor feature that tries to use your fastest individual CPU cores when running lightly threaded tasks rather than treating all cores the same. AMD doesn't put a number on this one but says the problem "may be more detectable" in processors with eight or more cores and a 65 W or higher TDP. This would include most 2000, 3000, 4000, and 5000-series Ryzen 7 and Ryzen 9 desktop CPUs and APUs. AMD says that a "software update," not a Windows update, will be released to fix the problem later in October, so you may need to install new AMD chipset drivers or some other software to get the fix.</p></div><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=1801973#p3">Read 1 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=1801973&comments=1">Comments</a></p>]]></content:encoded>

<p>Theranos founder Elizabeth Holmes’ charisma may have convinced the CEO of a major grocery store chain to form a partnership with the company, but it wasn’t enough to prevent the relationship from souring when the blood-testing startup inevitably couldn’t deliver on its promises.</p>
<p>In court for Holmes’ criminal trial yesterday, former Safeway CEO Steven Burd described how his admiration of Holmes and her company rose and then fell over the course of three years, from 2010 until 2013, when he retired. Holmes has been charged with 10 counts of wire fraud and two counts of conspiracy to commit wire fraud.</p>
<p>When Burd first heard of Holmes’ startup and its promised rapid blood testing technology, he <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/article/elizabeth-holmes-theranos-trial-updates.html">said</a> he was “immediately interested in meeting Theranos, particularly the founder.” The idea that people could give a small amount of blood and quickly receive the results “was a fascinating concept.”</p></div><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=1801978#p3">Read 11 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=1801978&comments=1">Comments</a></p>]]></content:encoded>

<div><a name="page-1"></a></div>
<p>In a groundbreaking initiative announced by the Department of Justice this week, federal contractors will be sued if they fail to report a cyber attack or data breaches. The newly introduced "Civil Cyber-Fraud Initiative" will leverage the existing <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/False_Claims_Act" target="_blank" rel="noopener">False Claims Act</a> to pursue contractors and grant recipients involved in what the DOJ calls "cybersecurity fraud." Usually, the False Claims Act is used by the government to tackle civil lawsuits over false claims made in relation to federal funds and property connected with government programs.</p>
<h2>Cyber contractors chose silence “for too long”</h2>
<p>"For too long, companies have chosen silence under the mistaken belief that it is less risky to hide a breach than to bring it forward and to report it,” said Deputy Attorney General Lisa O. Monaco, who is pioneering the initiative. "Well, that changes today. We are announcing today that we will use our civil enforcement tools to pursue companies, those who are government contractors who receive federal funds, when they fail to follow required cybersecurity standards—because we know that puts all of us at risk. This is a tool that we have to ensure that taxpayer dollars are used appropriately and guard the public fisc and public trust."</p>
<p>The introduction of the Civil Cyber-Fraud Initiative is the "direct result" of the department's ongoing thorough review of the cybersecurity landscape ordered by the deputy attorney general in May. The goal behind these review activities is to develop actionable recommendations that enhance and expand the DOJ's efforts to combat cyber threats.</p></div><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=1801922#p3">Read 9 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=1801922&comments=1">Comments</a></p>]]></content:encoded>

<p>In our main Windows 11 <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2021/10/windows-11-the-ars-technica-review/">review</a> posted earlier this week, we covered the majority of new features and design decisions in Microsoft's newest consumer OS—and it feels reasonable to characterize the overall impression given there as "lukewarm." The good news is that we still hadn't covered the best part of Windows 11: Linux.</p>
<p>For years now, Windows 10's Windows Subsystem for Linux has been making life easier for developers, sysadmins, and hobbyists who have one foot in the Windows world and one foot in the Linux world. But WSL, handy as it is, has been hobbled by several things it could <em>not</em> do. Installing WSL has never been as easy as it should be—and getting graphical apps to work has historically been <em>possible</em> but also a pain in the butt that required some fairly obscure third-party software.</p>
<p>Windows 11 finally fixes both of those problems. The Windows Subsystem for Linux isn't <em>perfect</em> on Windows 11, but it's a huge improvement over what came before.</p></div><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=1801283#p3">Read 25 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=1801283&comments=1">Comments</a></p>]]></content:encoded>

<p>Idaho Lt. Gov. Janice McGeachin grabbed the reins Tuesday by banning COVID-19 vaccination "passports" and mandatory COVID-19 testing in the state while Gov. Brad Little was away on travel. She also sought information on deploying the National Guard to the Texas border.</p>
<p>Gov. Little was, in fact, in Texas on Tuesday, meeting with nine other Republican governors regarding the Biden administration's handling of border issues.</p>
<p>"I am in Texas performing my duties as the duly elected Governor of Idaho, and I have not authorized the Lt. Governor to act on my behalf," Little said <a href="https://www.facebook.com/governorbradlittle/posts/414932983337521">in a statement late Tuesday</a>. "I will be rescinding and reversing any actions taken by the Lt. Governor when I return."</p></div><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=1801880#p3">Read 9 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=1801880&comments=1">Comments</a></p>]]></content:encoded>

<div><a name="page-1"></a></div>
<p>On Wednesday, the World Health Organization (WHO) <a href="https://www.who.int/news/item/06-10-2021-who-recommends-groundbreaking-malaria-vaccine-for-children-at-risk">announced a first</a>: it was recommending a vaccine against malaria for administration to children. The decision follows <a href="https://arstechnica.com/science/2019/04/malaria-vaccine-rollout-is-a-gamble-an-imperfect-tool-used-imperfectly/">a program started in 2019</a> in three African countries, which eventually saw over 800,000 children vaccinated.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://www.malariavaccine.org/sites/www.malariavaccine.org/files/content/page/files/PATH_MVI_RTSS_Fact%20sheet_042019.pdf">vaccine itself</a> is called RTS,S/AS01 or Mosquirix, and it checks all the boxes for conspiracy theorists, having been developed by a large pharmaceutical company (GlaxoSmithKline) with support from the Gates Foundation. The vaccine is based on proteins found on the surface of the most common malarial parasite, and it requires four doses starting when children are less than a year old. Development of the vaccine started in 1987, and testing of its efficacy dates back to 2014. With over 2.3 million doses administered, it has a solid safety profile, and it has shown an efficacy between 30 and 50 percent in different trials.</p>
<p>That may not seem all that great, especially compared to the numbers we've all watched many of the <a href="https://arstechnica.com/tag/covid-19/">COVID-19</a> vaccines produce. But the WHO estimates that over a quarter-million children under the age of 5 die of malaria every year in Africa alone, with many others falling seriously ill. As such, even a 30 percent efficacy can have a substantial impact.</p></div><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=1801872#p3">Read 3 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=1801872&comments=1">Comments</a></p>]]></content:encoded>

<p>A <a href="https://www.reuters.com/investigates/special-report/usa-oneamerica-att/">Reuters report</a> published today with the title "How AT&amp;T helped build far-right One America News" alleges that the telecom giant played a significant role "in creating and funding OAN, a network that continues to spread conspiracy theories about the 2020 election and the COVID-19 pandemic."</p>
<p>While there's no evidence or allegation that AT&amp;T played a direct role in creating OAN, Reuters points to a court case in which OAN's founder said he created the network after AT&amp;T "told us they wanted a conservative network." OAN also apparently gets the vast majority of its revenue from a carriage deal with the AT&amp;T-owned DirecTV, which is by far the largest cable or satellite TV provider that carries the channel. OAN is <a href="https://www.oann.com/wheretowatch/">carried by</a> providers including DirecTV, AT&amp;T U-verse, Verizon FiOS, and CenturyLink, but not by large cable operators such as Comcast, Charter, and Cox.</p>
<p>OAN owner Herring Networks claimed in a <a href="courtlistener.com/docket/5929058/herring-networks-inc-v-at-and-t-services-inc/">2016 lawsuit</a> that AT&amp;T promised to carry OAN on DirecTV in exchange for OAN's public support of AT&amp;T's attempt to purchase the satellite provider, which required government approval. OAN's lawsuit claimed that AT&amp;T reneged on the deal once its purchase of DirecTV was finalized in 2015. OAN finally got on DirecTV in 2017, weeks after agreeing to drop its lawsuit against AT&amp;T. Herring also claimed in court that AT&amp;T in 2013 proposed acquiring a 5 percent ownership stake in Herring, but that purchase was never made.</p></div><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=1801788#p3">Read 16 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=1801788&comments=1">Comments</a></p>]]></content:encoded>

<p>Platinum is a ferociously expensive metal that is difficult to obtain and purify. Most of the small supply we produce every year isn't put to use for its properties as a metal. Instead, it's used as a catalyst for producing a variety of chemicals—and for cleaning up your car's exhaust. Everything made with platinum carries an added burden of cost and environmental damage because of that use.</p>
<p>This year, the Nobel Prize in Chemistry honors two researchers for helping to trigger a burst of research into catalysts that leave the metals behind. Benjamin List and David MacMillan made key discoveries that started the field of organocatalysis, developing catalysts that could be made from cheap, common chemicals. Their work took a disorganized set of anecdotes and gave them a strong conceptual footing that allowed many other labs to go further.</p>
<h2>Not so metal</h2>
<p>At their heart, chemical reactions involve the transfer of electrons, either between atoms or into new configurations of chemical bonds. Metals are often effective catalysts because they ease the process of transferring electrons. Many metals will easily make a temporary loan of their electrons during a reaction or, if properly prepared, can draw electrons from other chemicals in order to hasten a process.</p></div><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=1801799#p3">Read 12 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=1801799&comments=1">Comments</a></p>]]></content:encoded>
